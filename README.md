# Unique Latin Word Finder

Finds the unique Latin words (up to equivalence by declension) from a corpus using whitaker's words. Great making a vocabulary list from a given corpus of text.

1. `git clone {this repository} --recursive`
2. Make whitakers-words using the instructions in there. For a Debian-based system it will be `cd whitakers-words ; sudo apt-get install gprbuild gnat ; make ; cd ..`
3. In your Python environment, install `numpy` and `pexpect`.
4. Use `finder.ipynb`.
